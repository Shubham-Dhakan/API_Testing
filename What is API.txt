
API - is like connector between two services.
      For eg1: In restuarant we send request to bring specific food, 
      **NOTE**- "waiter" takes our request into kitchen to get specific food.

      **NOTE**- waiter acts as "API" which takes client request to database(kitchen) 
		and "API" brings back the response(food) from database(kitchen) to client.

Thus, API is known or works as < Buisness Logic >.

Also lets say client is using some different language and server(database) is operating on different language 

*****NOTE***** API does the middle work to understand the both the languages(buisness logic), 

and take the client "request" --> gives "response" from (database) in feedback.
