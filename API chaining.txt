API Chaining Concept:
------------------------->

STEP1: 
------> 
For eg: We will create two HTTP requests:
	1. GET
	2. PUT

STEP2:
------->
Create Test case in "GET" request

TestCase:

jsondata=JSON.parse(responseBody);	# JSON.parse(responseBody) will copy entire api response in << jsondata >> (variable)
value = jsondata.data[1].first_name;	# calling and storing the specific user from the group of users in value (variable). 
pm.globals.set("username",value);	# we will set the global variable from GET <<testcase >>
				        # which will get used in "2" request PUT.  	

 STEP3:
---------->
Update body in << request section >> in -------------> "PUT" request

by using the global variable in the request body of << PUT >> request it is called api chaining. 
As we have set new global variable in the "" test case "" of previous request << GET >>

NOTE: Concept is using the input of input of first request  in another is known as api chaining.
