EXPORTING AND IMPORTING Collections in POSTMAN: 
--------------------------------------------------->

1) Export collection as File and Import as file
2) Export collection to a folder and Import Collection to a folder
3) Share Collection -> Get Public link then import as link
4) Import as Raw Text --> Curl Command --> Import

Curl Concept: is a command line interface for transfering the data via uRLS
	      When it comes to REST APIS, we can use Postman as a GUI (graphical user interface) 
	      and cURL as command line interface to perform tasks.
