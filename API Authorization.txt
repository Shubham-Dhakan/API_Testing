WHAT IS Authorization in POSTMAN: 
----------------------------------->
All the methods below are for understanding why&what is AUTHORIZATION is POSTMAN. 

1) Basic Auth - For eg: 
------------------------------>
			We are trying to fetch some data through GET HTTP request method,
			but that < GET > method needs authorization before getting called. 
			<<<< username: , password: >>>> 
			After entering them we can get the data of GET req.

2) API KEY - For eg: 
------------------------------>
		     Some GET | POST | PUT request needs api keys to perform 
		     any HTTP request. 

		     After entering the API key we can perform our desired actions,
		     through HTTP req methods. 

3) Bearer Token / Oauth 2.0:
------------------------------->
		     GIT repositories uses Bearer Token, so copy --> token,
		     2) In postman --> Authorization Section 
		     3) Select Token Method --> Paste the Git token 
		     4) To work with git API we need this tokens (if needed)
