WHAT IS DATA DRIVEN TESTING?
--------------------------------->

Breif Description:
Data driven testing is a testing carried through spreadsheet or some table in which multiple data is stored all ready which can be 
tested at a single shot rather than testing individual test-cases again and again. 

FILE TYPES:- .XML, .JSON, .CSV
 
CONCLUSION:
----------------->

1) Data-driven is a test automation framework which stores test data in a table or spread spreadsheet format.

2) In Data-driven test automation framework, input data can be stored in single or multiple data sources like xls, XML, csv, and databases.

3) To create an individual test for each data set is a lengthy and time-consuming process,
   Data Driven Testing framework resolves this issue by keeping the data separate from Functional tests.

4) In Data Driven Testing, it is an ideal option to use realistic information

5) It allows testing application with multiple sets of data values during Regression testing

6) Drawback of this method is that it is depended on the automation skills of the Implementing team
